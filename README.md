# Sortable Drag and Drop List Project

## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of a sortable drag and drop list using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vite. It allows users to interact with elements on the page by clicking and dragging them to different locations within a list, effectively changing the order of the list items.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Used for structuring the content on the webpage.
- CSS: Used for styling the webpage and the draggable list items.
- JavaScript: Used for implementing the sortable drag and drop functionality.
- Vite: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

## Features
- Sortable List: Users can click on a list item, drag it to a different location within the list, and drop it, thereby changing the order of the list items.
- Visual Feedback: The list item being dragged changes its appearance, providing visual feedback to the user.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the webpage.
5. To drag a list item, click and hold the left mouse button on it, move it to the desired location within the list, and then release the mouse button to drop it.

## Build
To create a production build, run `npm run build`. Vite will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready website.

## Deploy
To deploy to github, run `npm run deploy`.
